                Richard Hambleton was born in Vancouver in 1952 and is best known for his sinister shadow man silhouettes daubed on buildings in New York.

                Hambleton studied at the Vancouver School of Art and began his striking “Image Mass Murder” series in 1976, taking influence from the chalk outlines drawn by the police at murder scenes.</p>

                Hambleton created these “crime scenes” in 15 major US and Canadian cities, working with volunteers who would pose as murder victims and using red paint and graphic forms to unsettle the viewer. </p>

                Unlike traditional street tags, Hambleton’s work invited pedestrians to pause and ponder the meaning behind his work rather than serving up provocative messages or creating colourful murals.</p>

                  In 1979 Hambleton permanently settled in New York and began to work in his studio rather than directly on the streets. </p>

                Today Hambleton’s works grace top galleries and museums across the world including the Brooklyn Museum, the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, and The Museum of Modern Art in New York. </p>
